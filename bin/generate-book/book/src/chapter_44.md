### Private Recipes

Recipes and aliases whose name starts with a `_` are omitted from `just --list`:

````make
test: _test-helper
  ./bin/test

_test-helper:
  ./bin/super-secret-test-helper-stuff
````

````sh
$ just --list
Available recipes:
    test
````

And from `just --summary`:

````sh
$ just --summary
test
````

This is useful for helper recipes which are only meant to be used as dependencies of other recipes.
