### Emacs

[just-mode](https://github.com/leon-barrett/just-mode.el) provides syntax highlighting and automatic indentation of `justfile`s. It is available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/) as [just-mode](https://melpa.org/#/just-mode).

[justl](https://github.com/psibi/justl.el) provides commands for executing and listing recipes.

You can add the following to an individual `justfile` to enable `make` mode on a per-file basis:

````text
# Local Variables:
# mode: makefile
# End:
````
