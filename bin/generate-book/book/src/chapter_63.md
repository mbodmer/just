### Janus

[Janus](https://github.com/casey/janus) is a tool that collects and analyzes `justfile`s, and can determine if a new version of `just` breaks or changes the interpretation of existing `justfile`s.

Before merging a particularly large or gruesome change, Janus should be run to make sure that nothing breaks. Donâ€™t worry about running Janus yourself, Casey will happily run it for you on changes that need it.
